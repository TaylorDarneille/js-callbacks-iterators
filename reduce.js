var numbers = [1, 56, 2, 4, 1, 99, 3, 5];

// Your code here!


let sumNum = nums.reduce((acc, val) => {
  return acc * val
})
console.log(sumNum)


// Write something that takes the above array and returns the product of all the numbers
// via multiplication

//Seth exmplained to me that this was just a code to multiply the numbers in the string. 
//acc representation of 0 
//val representation of values in the array
// not sure why it's not working tho
